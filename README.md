This is my very first learning project to learn PHP and MySQL

## Requirements

* PHP 7.4

* A web server configured to run PHP, e.g. Apache

## Setup

1. Import the SQL file `simple-blog.sql` into MySQL it will create the database called `simple_blog`
2. Create a user in MySQL with DML rights on the new database
3. Edit `global_config.php` and adjust the following values:

| var | description |
| -- | -- |
| `$host` | MySQL server host |
